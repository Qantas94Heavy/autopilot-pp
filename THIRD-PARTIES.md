which have been explicitly released into the public domain by the copyright
author.  Here is an extract from [their website][2] (current as of writing):

> For more intense work, we have a [CSV][3]-formatted data dump of all our
> airports, countries, and regions, which we update every night.  You can
> download these files and open them with almost any spreadsheet program or
> import them into your own database.  You can even use them to set up your
> own, competing airport web site if you'd like!  We'd love you to give us
> credit, [like we give credit to our sources][4], but you're not required to.

> **DOWNLOAD AND USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**  We hereby release all of these files
> into the [Public Domain][5], **with no warranty of any kind** — By
> downloading any of these files, you agree that OurAirports.com, Megginson
> Technologies Ltd., and anyone involved with the web site or company hold **no

> not limited to) computer damage, lost revenue, flying into cliffs, or a
> general feeling of drowsiness that persists more than two days.

> **Do you agree** with the above conditions?  If so, then download away!
