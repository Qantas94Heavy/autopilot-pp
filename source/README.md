Autopilot++ v{0} for GeoFS

How to Use
----------

First install Autopilot++ using the installation instructions below.

After installing Autopilot++, load GeoFS and open the "Nav" panel.  To activate
the master switch, click the "Disengaged" button.  Once the master switch is
enabled, toggle the sliders next to "Altitude", "Heading" or "Speed" to
activate these modes.

### Navigation Modes

Click the "Heading mode" button to switch between the following modes:

 - Heading mode
 - Lat/lon mode
 - Waypoint mode

In the non-heading modes, the lateral mode of the autopilot is
always activated.  To turn the lateral mode off, first switch to
"Heading mode", then toggle the switch for "Heading".

### Vertical Speed

"-----" indicates that vertical speed (V/S) is under automatic control.

To set the V/S manually, click the V/S input and enter the value to set.

To return V/S to automatic control, clear the input and click outside the
input field or press Enter.
